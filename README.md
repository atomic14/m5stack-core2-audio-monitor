# M5Stack Core 2 Audio

You can watch a video explainer [here (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwIWpBqa-nM) which goes into a bit more detail on the audio capabilities of the device.

This project is a nice little demo of audio on the M5Stack Core 2 with some simple visualisations.

You'll need to use PlatformIO to build the project.

To clone the repo use:

```
git clone https://github.com/atomic14/m5stack-core2-audio-monitor.git
```

Hopefully, the code should be easy to understand.

If you want to add some more visualisations then please open up a pull request and contribute some code.

And if you'd like to buy me a coffee...
